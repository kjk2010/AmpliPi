The schematics for all shipped AmpliPi units are available in this directory.
This document details the specific board versions that were shipped together.

Board versions consist of a number and a letter.
A number change indicates a change to the PCB.
A letter change indicates a change to the schematics only.
Schematic changes could include part number changes, DNPs, etc.
